    "Apache Spark is known as a fast, easy-to-use and general engine for big data processing that has built-in modules for streaming, SQL, Machine Learning (ML) and graph processing. This technology is an in-demand skill for data engineers, but also data scientists can benefit from learning Spark when doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature extraction and, of course, ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll interface Spark with Python through PySpark, the Spark Python API that exposes the Spark programming model to Python. More concretely, you’ll focus on\n",
    "\n",
    "    Installing PySpark locally on your personal computer and setting it up so that you can work with the interactive Spark shell to do some quick, interactive analyses on your data. You’ll see how to do this with pip, Homebrew and via the Spark download page.\n",
    "    Learning how to work with the basics of Spark: you’ll see how you can create RDDs and perform basic operations on them.\n",

    "Apache Spark Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're rather interested in using Spark with R, you should check out DataCamp’s free Introduction to Spark in R with sparklyr or download the PySpark SQL cheat sheet.\n",
    "Installing Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Spark and getting it to work can be a challenge. In this section, you’ll cover some steps that will show you how to get it installed on your pc.\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing that you want to do is checking whether you meet the prerequisites. Spark is written in Scala Programming Language and runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) environment. That’s why you need to check if you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You do this because the JDK will provide you with one or more implementations of the JVM. Preferably, you want to pick the latest one, which, at the time of writing is the JDK8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you’re reading to download Spark!\n",
    "Downloading pyspark with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can download and install PySpark it with the help of pip. This is fairly easy and much like installing any other package. You just run the usual command and the heavy lifting gets done for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ pip install pyspark\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also go to the Spark download page. Keep the default options in the first three steps and you’ll find a downloadable link in step 4. Click on that link to download it. For this tutorial, you’ll download the 2.2.0 Spark Release and the “Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 and later” package type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the download can take some time to finish!\n",
    "Downloading Spark with Homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install Spark with the Homebrew, a free and open-source package manager. This is especially handy if you’re working with macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply run the following commands to search for Spark, to get more information and to finally install it on your personal computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Search for spark\n",
    "$ brew search spark\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get more information on apache-spark\n",
    "$ brew info apache-spark\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install apache-spark\n",
    "$ brew install apache-spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and Set Up Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, make sure that you untar the directory that appears in your Downloads folder. This can happen automatically for you, by double clicking the spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz archive or by opening up your Terminal and running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ tar xvf spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, move the untarred folder to /usr/local/spark by running the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ mv spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7 /usr/local/spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you get an error that says that the permission is denied to move this folder to the new location, you should add sudo in front of this command. The line above will then become $ sudo mv spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7 /usr/local/spark. You’ll be prompted to give your password, which is usually the one that you also use to unlock your pc when you start it up :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’re all set to go, open the README file in the file path /usr/local/spark. You can do this by executing\n",
    "\n",
    "$ cd /usr/local/spark\n",
    "\n",
    "This will brings you to the folder that you need to be. Then, you can start inspecting the folder and reading the README file that is incuded in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, use $ ls to get a list of the files and folders that are in this spark folder. You’ll see that there’s a README.md file in there. You can open it by executing one of the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open and edit the file\n",
    "$ nano README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "# Just read the file \n",
    "$ cat README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip use the tab button on your keyboard to autocomplete as you’re typing the file name :) This will save you some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see that this README provides you with some general information about Spark, online documentation, building Spark, the Interactive Scala and Python shells, example programs and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that could interest you most here is the section on how to build Spark but note that this will only be particularly relevant if you haven’t downloaded a pre-built version. For this tutorial, however, you downloaded a pre-built version. You can press CTRL + X to exit the README, which brings you back to the spark folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you selected a version that hasn’t been built yet, make sure you run the command that is listed in the README file. At the time of writing, this is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ build/mvn -DskipTests clean package run\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve successfully installed Spark and PySpark, let’s first start off by exploring the interactive Spark Shell and by nailing down some of the basics that you will need when you want to get started. In the rest of this tutorial, however, you’ll work with PySpark in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "Spark Applications Versus Spark Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive shell is an example of a Read-Eval(uate)-Print-Loop (REPL) environment; That means that whatever you type in is read, evaluated and printed out to you so that you can continue your analysis. This might remind you of IPython, which is a powerful interactive Python shell that you might know from working with Jupyter. If you want to know more, consider reading DataCamp’s IPython or Jupyter blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can use the shell, which is available for Python as well as Scala, for all interactive work that you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides this shell, you can also write and deploy Spark applications. In contrast to writing Spark applications, the SparkSession has already been created for you so that you can just start working and not waste valuable time on creating one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might wonder: what is the SparkSession?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it’s the main entry point for Spark functionality: it represents the connection to a Spark cluster and you can use it to create RDDs and to broadcast variables on that cluster. When you’re working with Spark, everything starts and ends with this SparkSession. Note that before Spark 2.0.0, the three main connection objects were SparkContext, SqlContext and HiveContext.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see more on this later on. For now, let’s just focus on the shell.\n",

    "When you see this, you know that you’re ready to start experimenting within the interactive shell!\n",

    "Tip: if you prefer using the IPython shell instead of the Spark shell, you can do this by setting the following environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=\"/usr/local/ipython/bin/ipython\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s start small and make an RDD, which is the most basic building block of Spark. An RDD simply represents data but it’s not one object, a collection of records, a result set or a data set. That is because it’s intended for data that resides on multiple computers: a single RDD could be spread over thousands of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), because Spark automatically partitions the data under the hood to get this parallelism. Of course, you can adjust the parallelism to get more partitions. That’s why an RDD is actually a collection of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily create a simple RDD by using the parallelize() function and by simply passing some data (an iterable, like a list, or a collection) to it:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> rdd1 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([('a',7),('a',2),('b',2)])\n",
    ">>> rdd2 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([(\"a\",[\"x\",\"y\",\"z\"]), (\"b\",[\"p\", \"r\"])])\n",
    ">>> rdd3 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(range(100))\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the SparkSession object has the SparkContext object, which you can access with spark.sparkContext. For backwards compatibility reasons, it’s also still possible to call the SparkContext with sc, as in rdd1 = sc.parallelize(['a',7),('a',2),('b',2)]).\n",
    "RDD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have created the RDDs, you can use the distributed data in rdd1 and rdd2 to operate on in parallel. You have two types of operations: transformations and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to intuitively get the difference between these two, consider some of the most common transformations are map(), filter(), flatMap(), sample(), randomSplit(), coalesce() and repartition() and some of the most common actions are reduce(), collect(), first(), take(), count(), saveAsHadoopFile().\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations are lazy operations on a RDD that create one or many new RDDs, while actions produce non-RDD values: they return a result set, a number, a file, …\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, for example, aggregate all the elements of rdd1 using the following, simple lambda function and return the results to the driver program:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> rdd1.reduce(lambda a,b: a+b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing this line of code will give you the following result: ('a', 7, 'a', 2, 'b', 2). Another example of a transformation is flatMapValues(), which you run on key-value pair RDDs, such as rdd2. In this case, you pass each value in the key-value pair RDD rdd2 through a flatMap function without changing the keys, which is the lambda function defined below and you perform an action after that by collecting hte results with collect().\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> rdd2.flatMapValues(lambda x: x).collect()\n",
    "[('a', 'x'), ('a', 'y'), ('a', 'z'), ('b', 'p'), ('b', 'r')]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have covered some basics with the interactive shell, it’s time to get started with some real data. For this tutorial, you’ll make use of the California Housing data set. Note, of course, that this is actually ‘small’ data and that using Spark in this context might be overkill; This tutorial is for educational purposes only and is meant to give you an idea of how you can use PySpark to build a machine learning model.\n",
    "Loading And Exploring Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though you know a bit more about your data, you should take the time to go ahead and explore it more thoroughly; Before you do this, however, you will set up your Jupyter Notebook with Spark and you’ll take some first steps to defining the SparkContext.\n",
    "PySpark in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the tutorial, you won’t use the ishell but you’ll build your own application. You’ll do this in a Jupyter Notebook. You already have all the things that you need installed, so you don’t need to do much to get PySpark to work in Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can just launch the notebook application the same way like you always do, by running $ jupyter notebook. Then, you make a new notebook and you simply import the findspark library and use the init() function. In this case, you’re going to supply the path /usr/local/spark to init() because you’re certain that this is the path where you installed Spark."

To make your life easier, you will move on from the RDD and convert it to a DataFrame. Dataframes are preferred over RDDs whenever you can use them. Especially when you’re working with Python, the performance of DataFrames is better than RDDs.\n",

This means that you don’t care about imposing a schema while processing or accessing the attributes by name or column. Tying in to what was said before about performance, by using RDDs, you don’t necessarily want the performance benefits that DataFrames can offer for (semi-) structured data. Use RDDs when you want to manipulate the data with functional programming constructs rather than domain specific expressions.\n",
